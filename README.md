# salah-notifs
A python CLI service for Linux which does only one thing; sends a notification at the adhān and iqāma of each prayer.

## Dependancies
- python
- notify-send

That's it. I tried to ensure it had as little dependencies as possible.

## Installation
Clone this repository. Assuming you placed the repository in `~/code` (place it anywhere you want, this is just an example), set this command to auto-start when you launch your computer: `python3 ~/code/notify-salawat/main.py`.

A Nix flake for NixOS and home-manager is coming soon.

## Configuration
Customization options are coming soon.
